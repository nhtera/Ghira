// The Worker for ghira.app (cf CLI and the Cloudflare Vite plugin).
//
// Every page is prerendered into the static assets, which are served before
// the Worker runs. The deployed Worker only sees paths with no page and
// answers them with 404.html, status 404 and the security headers. Its one
// binding is ASSETS (the site's own files); no secrets, no data bindings.
// No `domains`: ghira.app is attached once by hand, so the deploy token
// needs no zone permissions.
